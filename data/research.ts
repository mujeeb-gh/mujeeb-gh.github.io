    title: "Development of a Chatbot for Scholarly Research using Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
    abstract: "This study presents a specialized RAG architecture designed to query the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) anthology. By fine-tuning BAAI/bge-large embeddings and utilizing a vector-based retrieval mechanism, the system demonstrates a 97% retrieval accuracy and a 15% reduction in hallucinated content compared to baseline LLM responses. The research addresses the critical need for trustworthy AI in academic settings.",
